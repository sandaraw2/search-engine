Search Queries and Comments:

1. "computer science"
    Result: This query did not have enough search results and we had realized that the outcome was off due to our indexer. 
    Fix: We had to fix our indexer that was account for the amount of files we were scraping.
2. "master of software engineering"
    Result: The results of the query was showing us "master" AND "of" files along with "software" AND "of" files appended together.
    Fix: We had to change our conjunction handler to make sure it was filtering the previous sets of words before appending the next comparison.
3. "anteater"
    Result: There were no results.
    Fix: We were using a Stemmer at first, but decided to not include it because it was hindering our ability to search properly.
4. "This is another very long QUERY that might also take a very long time"
    Result: This was anticipated to fail, but we go some results since we did not leave out any stop words.
    Comment: There is no fix for this.
5. "cristina lopes"
    Result: We got this error - 
            File "/Users/vickiedo/Desktop/IR23F-A3-G83/streamlit_app.py", line 65, in <module>

            File "/Users/vickiedo/Desktop/IR23F-A3-G83/streamlit_app.py", line 36, in generate_results
                results_of_query = query(search_query)
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            File "/Users/vickiedo/Desktop/IR23F-A3-G83/queryhandler.py", line 48, in query
                temp_dict[token] = character_index[token]
    Fix: There was an error with our character_index[token] portion. Since the token did not already exists in our files, we could not open the file.
